# AI DB SQL Executor
This project is currently under development and is created purely for fun and experimentation.
## Overview
AI DB SQL Executor is a Rust-based tool that uses AI to generate SQL queries based on natural language input. It leverages the power of large language models to interpret user questions and convert them into executable SQL queries.
## Features
- Natural language to SQL conversion- Database schema analysis
- Integration with Ollama for AI processing- Support for PostgreSQL databases
## Status
This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. It's being developed as a personal project to explore the intersection of AI and database querying.
## Disclaimer
This tool is created for educational and experimental purposes. It may not always generate perfect or optimal SQL queries, and the results should be reviewed before use in any critical applications.
